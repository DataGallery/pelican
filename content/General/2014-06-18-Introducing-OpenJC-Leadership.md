Summary: 

OpenJC officially started on November 15, 2013.  Founded by Anna Lukasiak and Stephen Musgrove.  Jersey City has a large tech community yet civic tech was almost non-existent.  Most of the IT professinals work in companies in NYC, few started their own companies in Jersey City.

After six months, the Organization had over 100 members, over 15 meetups and a strong support from the local government.  We work closely with the mayor's aide, Brian Platt, who often attends our meetups and contributes to discussions and with council woman Candice Osborne, who is sponsoring Open Data Ordinance.

As the needs of the organization are growing, OpenJC expended their leadership to add four core team members:

James Solomon - Storyteller

Akisia Grigsby - Commuity Organizer

Emmanuel Simon - Delivery Lead

Victor Olex - Delivery Lead


James Solomon recently left Boston's Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics which utilized technology and constituent engagement to improve city services.  He implemented Street Bump, a first-of-its-kind mobile app that combines crowdsourcing with "big data" to detect potholes.  James earned his Master in Public Policy from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.  He brings experience working within local government and community organizing and outreach to this project.
Please congratulate them!
